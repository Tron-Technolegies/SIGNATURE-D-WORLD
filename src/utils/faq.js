    question: "What is a Payment Gateway?",
    answer: "A payment gateway is a technology-driven digital platform that enables online businesses to collect digital payments from their customers. It securely captures a transaction, encrypts the payment information, routes it to the card processor or banks, and returns either an approval or a decline notice. In essence, it acts as a secure intermediary that facilitates the flow of money from the buyer to the seller, supporting both online and offline transactions."

    question: "Do I need to pay to Instapay even when there is no transaction going on in my business?",
    answer: "It depends on the specific Instapay service you're using, as there are multiple services named Instapay. For example, Instapay.id states there are no subscription fees, and service fees are only charged on successfully paid invoices. However, some payment gateways may charge a monthly or annual maintenance fee regardless of transaction volume. You should check the pricing terms of the specific Instapay service you're using to confirm if there are any fixed fees when no transactions occur."

  {
    question: "What platforms does Instapay payment gateway support?",

Instapay.eg also provides a mobile app for instant payments.

    question: "Does Instapay provide international payments support?",
    answer: "Yes, some Instapay services support international payments. For example, Instapay from instapaytech.com allows customers to send money overseas to bank accounts, for cash pickup, or to local wallets in certain countries, using their e-wallet and associated Mastercard. However, not all Instapay services may offer this feature, so you should verify with the specific Instapay provider you're using to confirm their international payment capabilities."

  {
    question: "Is there any setup fee or annual maintenance fee that I need to pay regularly?",
    answer: "This varies by the Instapay service. For instance, Instapay.id mentions there are no subscription fees, with charges only on successful transactions. However, other payment gateways, like Cashfree, which integrates with services similar to Instapay, charge an annual maintenance fee (e.g., â‚¹4,999 annually) but no setup fee. You should review the pricing structure of the specific Instapay service you're using to determine if there are any setup or annual maintenance fees."
